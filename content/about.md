I'm a graduate student in the Master's of Computer Science program at KTH Royal Institue of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. I completed my bachelor's degree at SUNY Fredonia in 2015, majoring in Applied Music. After graduating from SUNY Fredonia I began working in professional audio. The more I learned about audio and its digital representation, the more I knew that I wanted to study computer science full time.
