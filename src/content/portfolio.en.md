## [This website](https://github.com/KirkEasterson/kirkeasterson.github.io)

My personal website built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) running on [github pages](https://pages.github.com). This isn't meant to be a showcase of my frontend abilities. The intent is to have one place where I can post my projects and talk about myself.

## [KALE (Kirk's Automated Linux Environment)](https://github.com/KirkEasterson/kale)

This is my personal bootstrap-setup for new dev machines and keeping my dev machines in sync. This project started with a series of over-engineered bash scripts, but was later ported to [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com). I plan on looking into replacing this with [nixos](https://nixos.org), but the ansible playbook works fine for now and I don't know how much benefit I will get from it. But it looks promising!

## [My dotfiles](https://github.com/KirkEasterson/.dotfiles)

In my opinion, every developer should have a repository with their dotfiles. It makes for consistency between machines and allows for projects such as [KALE](#kale) to exist. I treat this repo as a dumping ground for every in my `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` directory, and it has grown quite large over the years.
