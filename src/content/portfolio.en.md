## [This website](https://github.com/KirkEasterson/kirkeasterson.github.io)

My personal website which is always in a state of progress. It is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and runs on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). It isn't meant to be a showcase of my abilities. The intent is to have one place where I can post my projects and talk about myself.

## [KALE (Kirk's Automated Linux Environment)](https://github.com/KirkEasterson/kale)

This is my personal bootstrap setup for new dev machines, and how I also keep them in sync. [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is my preferred tool for this goal, but I plan to look into [nix](https://nixos.org/) soon.


## [My dotfiles](https://github.com/kirkeasterson/.dotfiles)

Every developer should have a dotfiles repository (in my opinion). I use this repository as a dumping ground for almost everything in my `~/.config/` directory, so it has grown quite large. But I frequently update it for my most used programs.
